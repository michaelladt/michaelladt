			    <p class="text-left my-4">The Sentinel was the most insane and over-ambitious personal projects of my life. Besides the initial 3D Modeling, every single aspect of the project was a first-time experience for me. I cannot wait to share the story of my process, successes, and failures. For now, I am focusing on the core content of my portfolio and creative technology sections to get my website launched. Since you took the time to stop by, I can most definitely share some media.</p>
			    
			    
			    <h3 class="text-left text-uppercase project-h3 pt-3" data-wow-delay="0.2s">The <strong>Goal</strong></h3>
			    
			    <p class="text-left mt-4">At this point, my goal was to get all of the pieces fitted and upright without any glue, ensuring that everything connected correctly before doing any permanent assembly. I also wanted the ability to paint the parts in a compartmentalized fashion, preassembling specific segments.</p>
