	    <p class="text-left mt-4">Business-to-business sales software didn't seem wildly attractive initially, but after a few coffees with then CEO Mike Frager, I became Director of Marketing at DYL. We had our work cut out for us. ~30% of existing contracts were about to expire, analytics reflected the site received little traffic, and lead generation was purely word of mouth. I led the charge to design and develop a new version of our site that was fully responsive, optimized for search, and fitted with testing, tracking, and segmentation tools to begin building our email lists.</p>

		<p class="text-left mb-4">As we built the site, I revamped the content. We steered away from buzzwords and geek speak, emphasizing the simple use of our products and features. Instead of talking about the system, we talked about how it benefits each unique customer.  Well, between the optimized site, the change in content strategy, and our email marketing campaigns, lead generation increased 5x over. More importantly, it increased our monthly recurring revenue by 300% and placed DYL among the inc5000 for the first time ever. I received terrific support from the sales team, Kris Sharma, Nick Wood, and Jared Passin. None of this could have been achieved without their hard work and harder salesmanship.</p>
