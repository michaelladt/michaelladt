			    <p class="text-left mt-4">This was the most insane and over-ambitious personal projects of my life. Besides the initial 3D Modeling, every single aspect of the project was a first-time experience for me. I cannot wait to share the story of my process, successes, and failures. For now, I am focusing on the core content of my portfolio and creative technology sections to get my website launched. Once I launch my website, I legitimately have six brush strokes left, I will varnish the model, and I will either start on a posed version or a version with full articulating parts.</p>

			    <p class="text-left mt-4">This part of the project was my first time opening a Marvel Legend, I don't typically open my figures, but I needed a 6 inch figure to show just how the extreme difference in scale. I also needed an X-Men figure, specifically with the more 90's retro look to match the Sentinel. </p>
