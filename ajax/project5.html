	    <p class="text-left my-5">Our digital sessions for the 2014 Lexus IS were not only effective but truly inspired. These sessions spawned many ideas, some are presented in my portfolio but some were created unbeknownst to me. As you might have seen, we launched an official Lexus Instagram and Tumblr. Additionally, we created a unique experience for the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition for the 2nd time, a 3rd would come later for a newer vehicle. I was also asked to create a deck for use in both the Creative and Media Departments... "How would we create the presence of the car if the car itself was not available?". Feel free to view my deckÂ <a class="text-link" href="/downloads/Lexus_IS_Presence_02-26-13.pdf" title="Michael Ladt - Lexus IS Presence Deck">here</a>, it gives a deeper look into my thought process and my ability to ideate. Keep in mind, this deck is almost 8 years old and many future campaigns were inspired by some of the concepts. I believe it is still relevant as it shows the types of forward-thinking for which I am capable.</p>
