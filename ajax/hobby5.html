			    <p class="text-left mt-4">This was the most insane and over-ambitious personal projects of my life. Besides the initial 3D Modeling, every single aspect of the project was a first-time experience for me. I cannot wait to share the story of my process, successes, and failures. For now, I am focusing on the core content of my portfolio and creative technology sections to get my website launched. I mounted a GoPro to my Airbrush booth and will have plenty of documentation to share, but I'd love to show you a few things for stopping by:</p>

			    <p class="text-left mt-4">Having never done any of this before, airbrushing included, I decided my best bet was to keep it simple. Spray primer, then spray metallic black on any parts that I wanted, and then spray pearlized paint in several coats while also getting very creative with my masking techniques.</p>

			    <p class="text-left mt-4">5mm tape, 2mm tape, tweezers, and patience I never knew I had. These were the tools at my disposal at first, but I later had a thought: I kept using sticky tack to mount the pieces to my turntable; why not use it to mask? It worked beautifully.</p>
