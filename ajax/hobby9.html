			    <p class="text-left my-4">I was scrolling through the <em>Action Figure Junkies</em> Facebook Group and I noticed a giant Sentinel Leg. I didn't think much of it, I figured Hasbro or some fan was messing around but I did take note of the size. Next thing I knew I was modeling and printing a giant sentinel head, but it wasn't good enough, I sought to make something huge on my little Elegoo Mars 3D printer. I began looking through the 1/6 scale statues from Sideshow Collectibles and Iron Studios. I wanted to base my design for the body off of the Sideshow Statue and use the head from Iron Studios to inspire the head.</p>

				<p class="text-left my-4">On July 10th Hasbro Pulse & HasLab announced they were crowdfunding a Master Mold Sentinel <a class="text-link" href="https://hasbropulse.com/products/x-men-legends-marvel-s-sentinel" target="_blank">here</a>. This inspired me to take my project to the next level. My plan, process, and execution can be seen throughout the hobby section of my site, or you can  <a class="text-link" href="" data-action="prev" title="previous">click here</a> to start the journey.</p>
