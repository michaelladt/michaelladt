			    <p class="text-left my-4">The Sentinel was the most insane and over-ambitious personal projects of my life. Besides the initial 3D Modeling, every single aspect of the project was a first-time experience for me. I cannot wait to share the story of my process, successes, and failures. For now, I am focusing on the core content of my portfolio and creative technology sections to get my website launched. Here is a quick glance at my iterative process.</p>

			    <p class="text-left mt-4">I designed over 30 before I was happy with the result; I also modified each piece and reprinted it anywhere from 3-5 times. I eventually decided to create access in 3 places throughout the torso for lighting, I added an insert that would be printed using an opaque resin for light to escape, and I used additional boolean operations with the shoulders so they would fit more easily. </p>

				<p class="text-left mt-4">I also split the shoulders into two pieces to make printing, painting, and assembly more simple. </p>
