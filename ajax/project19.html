	    <p class="text-left mt-4">Driven by Executive Creative Director Alastair Green and Group Creative Director Craig Crawford. Our digital sessions for the 2014 Lexus IS were not only practical but inspired. These sessions spawned many ideas. I was to create a deck alongside Max Miner(Experience Designer) for use in both the Creative and Media Departments, "How would we create the presence of the car without the car?". Feel free to view my deck <a class="text-link" href="/downloads/Lexus_IS_Presence_02-26-13.pdf" title="Michael Ladt - Lexus IS Presence Deck">here</a>; it gives a more in-depth look into my thought process and my ability to ideate.</p> 
		    
<p class="text-left mb-4">Some of the concepts born from the digital sessions are present throughout my portfolio, and others  were developed unbeknownst to me. Some of my concepts were simply ahead of their time and were subsequently produced after my departure. As you might have seen, we launched an official Lexus Instagram and Tumblr. Additionally, we created a unique experience for the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition for the 2nd time, and a 3rd would come later for a newer vehicle.</p>
